# Hello, I'm Lance
# I am a former U.S. Navy Information Systems Technician (Network) with a strong background in enterprise networking and cybersecurity fundamentals. This repository showcases hands-on projects in network security, detection, and incident response built to reflect real operational environments. The focus is on understanding why events occur, not just how tools produce results.
